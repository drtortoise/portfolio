			<h2>Scouts "Digital Maker Badge"</h2>
			<p>Client: Nesta/Scouts</p>
			<img src="img/scouts.jpg">
			<p>I got to make activities and lesson plans that Scout leaders can carry out with their group, to make things like websites, games and robots. I got to travel around the country and test out activities with different groups, with participants ages 6 to 14. Loads of fun was had by all :D</p>
			<p>Launches January 2014, <a href="http://scouts.org.uk/what-we-do/become-a-partner/nesta/">more info</a></p>

			<h2>Teaching programming on a remote island</h2>
			<p>Client: Lur√∏y kommune</p>
			<img src="img/lovund.jpg">
			<p>After a 2 hour flight and 5 hours on a ferry, I arrived at Lovund, where I taught HTML/CSS, Scratch and Python to kids aged 7-17 over a period of 4 days. My favourite bit was the kids sending loads of notes with secret messages on after I taught them basic encryption and decryption. One kid in particular was really sad about being there and didn't think he'd understand anything, but ended up making a website and several games by the end of it.</p>

			<h2>Happenstance</h2>
			<p>Client: Nesta/Spike Island art gallery</p>
			<img src="img/happenstance.png">
			<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/apr/26/happenstance-project-digital-arts">The Happenstance project was about putting digital thinking at the heart of arts organisations.</a> I was lucky to be a creative technologist in residence at an art gallery, where I got to play with all kinds of gadgets and sensors, as well as running arduino workshops, teach agile methodologies, and even a design jam. Favourite moment: Setting up a little polaroid printer to print out pictures people took around the gallery and artist's studios, which were then exhibited in the art gallery. Take that secondary school teacher who failed me in art!</p>

			<h2>Cycling game</h2>
			<p>Client: The Urban Environment Agency, the Municipality of Oslo</p>
			<img src="img/cycle.png">
			<p>The Municipality of Oslo asked me to make some flyers and a website for their upcoming campaign to encourage cycling during European Mobility week. However flyers are boring and instead I made a cycling game, using actual cycles as the controllers. They took the cycles with them on the various stands and fairs, and got people to get to the cycles and play the game to win prizes.</p>

			<h2>Campaign to stop littering</h2>
			<p>Client: The Urban Environment Agency, the Municipality of Oslo</p>
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZUhhvlezC_k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>The Municipality of Oslo runs yearly "attitude campaigns" to reduce littering. I showed them a video of a talking trash can done as a half-day experiment for the Fun Theory in Sweden. We decided to make a two week long campaign with the rubbish bins in downtown Oslo.</p>
